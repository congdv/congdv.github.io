Main uses of Stream API in Java 8 are:

I. It helps in using data in a declarative way. We can make use of Database functions like Max, Min etc., without running a full iteration.

II. It makes good use of multi-core architectures without worrying about multi-threading code.

III. We can create a pipeline of data operations with Java Stream that can run in a sequence or in parallel.

IV. It provides support for group by, order by etc. operations.

V. It supports writing for code in Functional programming style.
